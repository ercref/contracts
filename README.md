### What is ERC?
ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) is _one_ of the types of "Standards Track" of EIP(Ethereum Improvement Proposal), it's the application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards (EIP-20), name registries (EIP-137), URI schemes, library/package formats, and wallet formats.

### What is ERCRef?
Our mission at Project ERCRef is to establish a platform that facilitates ERC drafting discussions and encourages mass adoption of ERCs for smart contracts.

- **Reference Implementations** ERCRef offers an extensive collection of reference implementations submitted by ERC authors, contributors, and dApp builders. These implementations serve as a valuable resource for developers looking to incorporate ERCs into their smart contracts.

- **Ideas Showcase & Prototype Gallery** ERCRef serves as a space for developers to showcase their ideas and prototypes for smart contracts. By sharing their work, developers can receive feedback, collaborate with others, and inspire innovation.

- **Smart Contract Library** ERCRef also acts as a smart contract library with pioneer solutions, so builder could use it just like OpenZepplin contracts but with more variety and early adoption of ERCs. All content is  created & maintained by our community.
