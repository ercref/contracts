ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) is _one_ of the types of "Standards Track" of EIP(Ethereum Improvement Proposal), it's the application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards (EIP-20), name registries (EIP-137), URI schemes, library/package formats, and wallet formats.

Project ERCRef's mission is to faciliate ERC drafting discussion and advance ERC adopptions for smart contracts. It does so by
- providing a collection of Reference Implementations submitted by ERC authors, contributors and general dApp builders
- serving as a idea show case and prototype gallery for smart contracts
- serving as a smart contract library with pioneer solutions, so builder could use it just like OpenZepplin contracts but with more variety and early adoption of ERCs.

Please conduct security audit before using in production.
